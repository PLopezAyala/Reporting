This `.Rmd` file was written with the aim to aid you when writing your first reports in RMarkdown. It contains the most important features for creating a good reproducible report. The structure followed is not necessarily the one you should follow when performing your data analysis or reporting your results. The purpose of this template is simply to present you with a good structure for the data report and the code behind it. 

The structure used in this Rmarkdown report is the following:

* Background - describe in a concise way the background of the research field, the research question of interest, etc
* Data dictionary - makes it easier for the reader to know the meaning of each variable. Can select those variables of interest for analysis, no need to show the whole data set
* Flowchart - Show how many patients are excluded from the analysis
* Descriptive statistics - show univariable analysis for continuous and categorical variables so the audience has a good overlook of the data.
* Table 1 - There are better ways of describing your data, but everybody wants to see a Table 1
* Model - Visualize your model and your effects
* Conclusion
* Computer environment - always include the computer environment used. It fosters reproducibility

Through this report I have used different chunk options. Below a short summary of the ones I have used. For a detail explanation of these and many other chunk options, please check [this](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#chunk-options).

* `echo = FALSE` hide code (default is `TRUE` hence code is displayed) but result is shown
* `warning = FALSE` drop warnings from output document (default is `TRUE`)
* `message = FALSE` suppress messages (default is `TRUE`)
* `eval = FALSE` do not evaluate the code (default is `TRUE`) but the code appears if `echo=T` was chosen
* `include = FALSE` to hide both the code and the result from the rendered document but the code is still evaluated
* `fig.align = ` to align the figure. Four options exist `default`, `left`, `right` or `center`
* `fig.cap = ` write a figure caption
* `fig.dim = c(7,8)` choose dimensions of plot. Is a shorthand of `fig.width` = 7, `fig.height` = 8.
* `out.width = 70%` and `out.height = 80%` width and height of the plot in the output document, which can be different with its physical `fig.width` and `fig.height`, i.e., plots can be scaled in the output document.
* `dpi = ` dots per inch value (for image resolution). Default is 72

Note that this `.Rmd` file was written with the intention to knit to HTML. I believe that HTML files have more advantages than pdf or word files and are easier to present to your PI or colleagues.

# Background

The `Gusto-I trial` was a randomized trial comparing 4 thrombolytic strategies for acute myocardial infarction. The original study can be found [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199309023291001).

```{r picture, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '70%', fig.cap='GUSTO-I trial published in the NEJM.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/Gusto_NEJM.png") #need to download Figure from Repository (or simply suppress this chunk with eval=FALSE)
```

Our aim is to derive a model for predicting 30-day mortality. Because this is simply a template for showing how to use RMarkdown, I will not go into much detail and will simply get to the stage of model derivation and showing partial effect plots. Model validation with a resampling technique (e.g. bootstrap internal validation) will not be shown. Important aspects like discrimination and calibration of the model, shrinkage of coefficients for protection of future overfitting or plotting decision curve analysis for assessing net benefit of the model will not be shown here. ^[To learn prediction modelling the go-to source is Frank Harrell https://hbiostat.org/rmsc/ or Ewout Steyerberg https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-77244-8]

# Data

Data is obtained from http://hbiostat.org/data courtesy of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics.

```{r data}
load(url('http://hbiostat.org/data/gusto.rda'))
df <- as.data.frame(gusto)
```

# Data dictionary

```{r dictionary}
Hmisc::html(Hmisc::contents(df), levelType = 'table')
```


# Patient Flowchart 

We want to keep patients who received either streptokinase (`SK`) or primary angioplasty (`tPA`).

```{r flowchart, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Patient flowchart using the {consort} package.', dpi=100}
# dpi (dots per inch) for bitmap devices (dpi * inches = pixels). Default is 72
docl <- list()
docl[['all']] <- nrow(df)
docl[['sk_tPA']] <- table(df$tx)[1]
df <- df %>% filter(tx %in% c('SK', 'tPA'))
df$tx <- droplevels(df$tx) #tx was a three level categorical variable. Drop unused level (SK+tPA)
docl[['analysis']] <- nrow(df)

txt1 <- glue::glue("Patients recruited in \n the GUSTO-I trial \n (n={docl$all})")
txt1_side <- glue::glue("Excluded (n={docl$sk_tPA}):\n\u2022 Received SK+tPA (n={docl$sk_tPA})")
txt2 <- glue::glue("Main analysis \n (n={docl$analysis})")

flowchart <- consort::add_box(txt = txt1) %>% 
  consort::add_side_box(txt = txt1_side, dist = 0.05) %>%   
  consort::add_box(txt = txt2, dist = 0.05) 

plot(flowchart)
```

# Descriptive statistics


## Summary using `summarytools`

<!-- The code below is to allow scrolling in the horizontal axis. The `max.tbl.height` argument (in the code chunk) allows scrolling in the vertical axis -->
<!-- Syntax for horizontal scroll of plots from here: -->
<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52448104/how-to-add-horizontal-scroll-bar-for-a-ggplot-plot-in-rmarkdown-html -->

<style>
  .superbigimage{
      overflow-x:scroll;
      white-space: nowrap;
  }

  .superbigimage img{
     max-width: none;
  }


</style>

<div class="superbigimage">
```{r dfsummary, results = 'asis'}
print(summarytools::dfSummary(df, 
                              varnumbers = FALSE,
                              valid.col = FALSE,
                              labels.col = FALSE,
                              graph.magnif = 0.76,
                              headings = F), 
      max.tbl.height = 300,
      method = "render")
```
</div>

## Summary using `Hmisc` {.tabset}

```{r summary-hmisc}
d <- Hmisc::describe(df)
Hmisc::html(d) #use scroll = TRUE for scrolling the output table

```

### Continuous variables

The nice thing of `.html` format is the possibility of using interactive plots. The `plotly` package allows you to render interactive plots. Simply place your cursor on top of the figure and all the information for a specific point will be shown. 

```{r hmisc-cat, fig.align='center'}
p <- plot(d)
plotly::subplot(p[1])
```

### Categorical variables

The nice thing of `.html` format is the possibility of using interactive plots. The `plotly` package allows you to render interactive plots. Simply place your cursor on top of the figure and all the information for a specific point will be shown. 

```{r hmisc-cont, fig.align='center'}
plotly::subplot(p[2])
```

### Missings

There are no missings. 

```{r missings, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fractions of NAs per Variable.'}
dd <- rms::datadist(df); options(datadist = "dd")
na.patterns <- Hmisc::naclus(df)
Hmisc::naplot(na.patterns, 'na per var')
```


# Table 1

You can create a "Table1" directly in your `.Rmd` report, like done below. 

```{r table1, message=FALSE}

df_table1 <- df %>% 
  select(
    tx,
    age,
    sex,
    Killip,
    pulse,
    sysbp,
    htn,
    dia,
    smk,
    pmi,
    ste,
    day30
    ) %>% 
  mutate(htn = ifelse(htn == 2, 1, 0))

tbl_gtsummary_custom <- 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    df_table1,
    label = list(pulse ~ "Heart rate", 
                 sysbp ~ "Systolic Blood Pressure",
                 htn ~ "History of Hypertension",
                 dia ~ "Diabetes",
                 smk ~ "Smoking", 
                 pmi ~ "Previous MI",
                 ste ~ "Nbr ECG leads with ST-elevation",
                 day30 ~ "Dead in the first 30-days"), 
    by = tx, # split table by treatment received
    missing = "no" # don't list missing data separately
  ) %>%
  gtsummary::add_overall() %>% # add column with overall summary statistics
  gtsummary::add_n() %>% # add column with total number of non-missing observations
  gtsummary::modify_header(label = "**Variable**") # update the column header

#Add row headers
tbl_gtsummary_custom <- tbl_gtsummary_custom %>% 
  gtsummary::as_gt() %>% #convert to gt object and use gt functions
  gt::tab_row_group(label = "Outcome", rows = 20) %>% 
  gt::tab_row_group(label = "ECG findings", rows = 19) %>% 
  gt::tab_row_group(label = "CVRF, n (%)", rows = 12:18) %>% 
  gt::tab_row_group(label = "Vital signs", rows = 5:11) %>% 
  gt::tab_row_group(label = "Demographics", rows = 1:4) %>% 
  gt::tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "#EFEFEF"),
      cell_text(weight = "bold")
    ),
    locations = cells_row_groups()
  )

tbl_gtsummary_custom

```

However, you can also insert previously created `html` tables in your report. This is very handy because you do not need to write two times the same code. Usually you will have your full syntax code written in a `.R` syntax file and you will later create an .Rmd report for reporting main results, tables, plots, etc. If this is the case, you can save the table in `html` format from within your `.R` syntax file and insert it into your `.Rmd` file with the `htmltools` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
rawHTML_Table1 <- paste(readLines(glue::glue("./Tables/Table1.html")), collapse = "\n")
htmltools::HTML(rawHTML_Table1)
```

# Model

We are going to fit a logistic regression model. We want to obtain predicted probabilities with the model. Probabilities are obtained with the equation below.

$$
Probability = \frac{1}{1 + e^{(-(lp))}} \text{, where lp =  } \alpha + x_1\beta_1 + x_2\beta_2 + x_n\beta_n  
$$

Yes, you can insert equations in RMarkdown with LaTeX notation. Take a look at different [LaTeX symbols](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols).


```{r}
options(prType = 'html') #set print type option to html. Default is 'plain'
model <- rms::lrm(day30 ~ rcs(age, 4)*sex + tx + Killip + rcs(pulse, 4) +
               rcs(sysbp, 4) + miloc + pmi, x = T, y = T, data = df)
print(model, digits = 4, table = TRUE, conf.int = 0.95, 
      coefs = TRUE, title = 'Logistic regression model')
```


## Visualize Model {.tabset}

Suppose we would like to show different ways of visualizing/interpreting our model. We could show each Figure one below the other, but there is a more elegant way. Tabsets! Tabsets are very useful when wanting to report more than 1 Figure or Table. 

### Nomogram

```{r nom, fig.align='center', fig.dim=c(10,8), fig.cap='Nomogram.'}
plot(nomogram(model))
```

### Partial (conditional) effect plots

```{r pep, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Partial (conditional) effect plots. Probability scale instead of default log odds scale.'}
ggplot(rms::Predict(model, fun = plogis), rdata = df)
```


### More

```{r pep2, fig.align='center'}
sbp <- c(60, 80, 100, 120)
ggplot(rms::Predict(model, age, sysbp = sbp, fun = plogis)) 
```

### and more

```{r pep3, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(rms::Predict(model, age, sysbp = sbp, Killip, fun = plogis))
```


### Heatmap

```{r heat, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Heatmap showing predicted probabilities at different ages and systolic blood pressure for the 4 Killip classes.'}
pred_intx <- rms::Predict(model, age, sysbp, Killip, fun = plogis, np = 100) 
col <- base::rev(grDevices::heat.colors(999, alpha = 0.8))
bounds <- rms::perimeter(df$age, df$sysbp, lowess. = T) #to see where data really exists

rms::bplot(
  pred_intx,
  perim = bounds,
  ylab = "sysbp",
  col.regions = col
  )
```


# Conclusion

Hope this template will aid you when creating a `.html` report file with RMarkdown. Note that since RStudio version 
`version 1.4` or higher, R Markdown has incorporated a [visual editing mode](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/), making all aspects of creating and rendering a report very easy.
